Android app that searches articles from remote server and caches them locally with realtime syc with the new data when Network change occur (Offline)

Architecture
The App is not organized into multiple modules but follows the same principles of the Presentation, Domain, and Data Layers. The presentation layer handles the UI work with the logic contained in the ViewModel. The UI uses a LiveData object from the ViewModel and observes it using the Observer Pattern. A ListAdapter handles the actual displaying of the news. Data over the network is retrieved using retrofit and coroutines to handle background work asynchronously. Additionally, note that the ViewModel uses the viewModelScope to launch the couroutines while Fragments use the viewLifeCycleOwner to observe data. The data layer uses the recommended Repository Pattern to make the network calls and store the data using Room DB.


Once the app is launched, the user has the option of viewing general movies. Alternatively, using the navigation drawer, the user can alo open the discover shows screen. The drawer also has options for opening the favourites for both movies and shows.

Search Screen

This screen is accessible from all the screens and allows the user to search for movies or shows depending on the present fragment. If in the movies fragment, then the user will search for movies and vice versa
